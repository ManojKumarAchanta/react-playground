# React Online IDE Playground ⚛️

A minimal React playground where you can write JSX and CSS in two simple files and instantly see the output — no run button, no build step, just live preview.

---

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ Live JSX compilation (Babel in-browser)
- 🎨 Real-time CSS updates
- 💻 VS Code–powered editor (Monaco)
- 🔥 Instant preview in sandboxed iframe
- 🧩 Two-file structure:
  - `App.jsx`
  - `styles.css`

---

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. You write JSX in `App.jsx`
2. Babel compiles JSX to JavaScript
3. The compiled code is injected into an iframe
4. CSS from `styles.css` is applied
5. React renders automatically

No refresh required. No manual render button.
